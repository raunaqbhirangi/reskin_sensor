# Overview

The zip file contains all the information necessary to fabricate the 5X ReSkin circuit board. The BOM, Bill of Materials, details the components needed to populate the corresponding circuit design. You may choose to manufacture by yourself, if you have access to a PCB mill, and solder yourself, with a reflow oven. However, we recommend ordering your boards from a 3rd party vendor, such as PCBWay or OSHPark, as they are relatively inexpensive, quick, and high-quality. 

  ### Note: The shipping is often the biggest bottleneck in price and time - consider placing large, shared orders if you are able.

  ### Note: The main magnetometer chip, MLX90393, is currently very low-stock. This is out of our control, but we hope it is resolved soon. We recommend purchasing from reputable distributers such as Digikey or Mouser.

# Ordering circuit boards from PCBWay (One Example)

1. Navigate to [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/) and select ["PCB Instant Quote"](https://www.pcbway.com/orderonline.aspx) from the main menu bar.
2. The default option is to start a rigid boards. Select [FPC/Rigid Flex](https://www.pcbway.com/flexible.aspx) to start a flexible PCB order.
3. For rigid boards, select [quick-order PCB](https://www.pcbway.com/QuickOrderOnline.aspx) and upload the zip file here to "+Add Gerber File".
